# stilt v1.2.0 (Release date: 2017-11-02)
==============

Changes:

* In emul.lik.R and emulator.predict.R, the emulator now uses Cholesky decomposition for matrix inversion instead of using solve(). The relevant determinants are calculated from the diagonal entries of the Cholesky factors.
* The inverse of the parameter covariance is pre-calculated and attached to the emulator list, so that the inverse operation can be skipped for prediction at many points.
* Moved fields from depends to imports in the DESCRIPTION file.
* Minor code refactoring to improve functionality:
	- Use warning() and message() instead of cat for warnings and messages
	- Set llik <- -Inf in emul.lik.R if outside limits and exit to avoid calculating the case
	- Streamlined the naming convention of “parvec” so for loops and an if statement are not needed
