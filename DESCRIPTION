Description: Functions for simplified emulation of time series computer model output in model parameter space using Gaussian processes. Stilt can be used more generally for Kriging of spatio-temporal fields. There are functions to predict at new parameter settings, to test the emulator using cross-validation (which includes information on 95% confidence interval empirical coverage), and to produce contour plots over 2D slices in model parameter space.
